# Minimal Starter for 11ty 

## Installation

Install the needed artifacts and dependencies:

```
npm install
```

### Additional steps on Windows

In order to run 11ty locally on Windows systems, just install git to get the git bash.
Then activate this as default shell for 11ty:

```
npm config set script-shell "C:\\Program Files\\git\\bin\\bash.exe"
```

### Enable legacy OpenSSL provider

If running 11ty locally fails it might be because the current OpenSSL version is unsupported.
In that case, run the following command before starting running 11ty locally:

On Windows:
```
set NODE_OPTIONS=--openssl-legacy-provider 
```

On Unix:
```
export NODE_OPTIONS=--openssl-legacy-provider
```

## Run locally

Watches for changes and serves locally on http://localhost:8080

```
npm run serve
```

## Create a production build

```
npm run build
```
