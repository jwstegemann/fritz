Since we want you to build the best, most efficient, successful, and whatever-else-you-want web-apps with fritz2,
we happily provide you with all the documentation you need in order to use it.

We always try our best with fritz2 and would love your feedback! Please feel free to open an
[issue](https://github.com/jwstegemann/fritz2/issues).

Whenever you find something missing, misleading or even plain wrong in our documentation please open an
[PR](https://github.com/jwstegemann/fritz2/pulls) or [issue](https://github.com/jwstegemann/fritz2-docs/issues). 
Probably the easiest way to do so is by using the "Edit this page on Github" link you find at the bottom of each page.

We also encourage everybody to share their own examples and showcases with us,
as this is often the best way to learn something new.

## How to Read This Documentation

Most topics are split into three parts which differ in level of detail, abstraction, and importance:

- *Overview* - This section gives you a short overview about the topic and the supporting fritz2 APIs. 
It focuses on the big picture and might simplify some aspects. Read this to get a first impression about a feature
or as short reminder.
- *Essentials* - This section covers all essential aspects of a feature. You will need this knowledge in order to build
a real life fritz2 application.
- *Advanced Topics* - This section presents more advanced or special interest topics. Read this if you are interested
in deeper knowledge about a fritz2 feature.

If you are new to fritz2, we recommend reading all the *overview* sections first and skipping the rest for now.
Next, read the *essential* sections for Rendering, Store Creation and Store Mapping as these are the foundation for
fritz2 applications. All other essentials and the *advanced* topics will be much easier to understand after.

Please also have a look at our working code [examples](/examples) referenced throughout the documentation to help you 
progress.

## Where Does the Name Come From?

fritz2 actually has two meanings. For our project name, we were looking for something to connect it to St. Petersburg
(Kotlin is an island in its proximity), and we came across Friedrich II. It was shortened to Fritz2 - so technically,
there was a Fritz1, but he wasn't an API. The second meaning is personal and connects to the pipes in our logo:
Fritz is Jens‘ father’s nickname who had a huge impact on his life. He was a plumber.
