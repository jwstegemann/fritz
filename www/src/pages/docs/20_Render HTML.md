## Overview

fritz2 offers a rich DSL to create the HTML for your application. You just have to call the global `render` function
inside to create an initial `RenderContext` in which you can then call the HTML-Tag functions provided by fritz2
like `div`.

```kotlin
fun main() {
    render { // by default target = document.body
        div("header", id = "header") {
            
        }
        div("container") {
            h1 { +"Hello World!" }
        }
        div("footer") {

        }
    }
}
```

This code results in:

```html
<body id="target">
    <div id="header" class="header"></div>
    <div class="container">
        <h1>Hello World!</h1>
    </div>
    <div class="footer"></div>
</body>
```

### Apply Styling to your UI: Reactive or Static

The `class` attribute of a `Tag` for working with CSS style-classes is somewhat special. You can set the static values
of each `Tag` for `class` and `id` by using the optional parameters of its factory function:

```kotlin
render {
    div("some-static-css-class") {
        button(id = "someId")
    }
}
```

Use this one-liner to add styling and meaning to your elements by using semantic CSS class-names. Also, it keeps your
code clean when using CSS frameworks like Bootstrap, Tailwind etc.

To reactively change the styling of a rendered element, you can add dynamic classes by assigning a `Flow` of strings to
the `className`-attribute (like with any other attribute).

```kotlin
render {
    val enabled = storeOf(true)

    div("common-css-class") {
        className(enabled.data.map {
            if (it) "enabled-css-class"
            else "disabled-css-class"
        })
        +"Some important content"
    }
}
```

fritz2 also lets you manage multiple classes in a `List<String>` or `Flow<List<String>>` with the `classList`-attribute.

Additionally, you can build a `Map<String, Boolean>` from your model data that enables and disables single classes
dynamically:

```kotlin
render {
    div {
        classMap(toDoStore.data.map {
            mapOf(
                "completed" to it.completed, // a boolean-attribute in the data-model
                "editing" to it.editing
            )
        })
    }
}
```

fritz2 also offers a function for setting the inline `style` attribute to your elements:

```kotlin
render {
    p {
        inlineStyle("color: red")
        +"this is red text"
    }
}
```

Of course, it is also possible to dynamically style an element by passing a `Flow` of CSS styles into `inlineStyle`:
```kotlin
render {
    val enabled = storeOf(true)

    div {
        inlineStyle(enabled.data.map {
            if (it) "background-color: lightgreen;"
            else "opacity: 0.5; background-color: lightgrey;"
        })
        +"Some important content"
    }
}
```

To set an initial CSS class (or any other attribute) immediately (for example to avoid flicker effects caused by the delay
of the first value becoming available on the flow), the respective attribute-method must be called twice.
First with the static value that should be set immediately, then with the `Flow` that provides the dynamic values:

```kotlin
val visibility: Flow<String> = ...

className("invisible")
className(visibility)
```

### Apply Attributes to your UI: Reactive or Static

To create rich HTML interfaces styling alone is not sufficient. You will need to use a variety of attributes. 
In fritz2 there are several easy ways to achieve this, depending on your use case.

You can set all HTML attributes inside the `Tag`'s content by calling a function of the according name. Every standard
HTML attribute has two functions. One sets a static value every time the element is re-rendered, the second collects
dynamic data coming from a `Flow`. When coming from a `Flow`, the attribute's value will be updated in the
DOM whenever a new value appears on the `Flow`
without having to re-render the whole element:

```kotlin
val flowOfInts = ... // i.e. get it from some store

render {
    input {
        placeholder("some text")
        maxLength(flowOfInts)
        disabled(true)
    }
}
```

If you want to set a `Boolean` value, you can set an optional parameter `trueValue` which will be set as the
attribute-value if your data is `true`:

```kotlin
val isLow = myStore.data.map { i -> i <= 0 }

render {
    button {
        +"My button"
        attr("data-low", isLow, trueValue = "true")
        // isLow == true  -> <button data-low="true">My button</button>
        // isLow == false -> <button>My button</button>
    }
}
```

This is sometimes needed for CSS-selection or animations.

::: info
The `className` function you have already encountered is also just a way to set a common attribute on a tag - although
it works internally a bit different and offers more convenience variants due to its overall importance.
:::

To set a value for a custom (data-) attribute, use the `attr()`-function. It works for static and dynamic (from
a `Flow`) values:

```kotlin
render {
    div {
        attr("data-something", "someValue")
        attr("data-something", flowOf("someValue"))
    }
}
```

Sometimes it is important for an attribute to only appear if some condition is `true`, for example some
[ARIA](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA) properties like
[aria-controls](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Attributes/aria-controls) should
preferably appear only if the dependent element exist. The `attr` functions for `Flows` behave in such a way, that they
only set an attribute if the value is *not* `null`. This behaviour could be used to achieve the desired effect:

```kotlin
val isOpened = storeOf(true)

render {
    button {
        +"Toggle"
        // This mechanism is later explained in depth in "Store Creation" chapter.
        // Just accept for now this simply toggles the boolean value in the store by each click.
        clicks.map { !isOpened.current } handledBy isOpened.update

        attr("aria-controls", isOpened.data.map { if (it) "disclosure" else null })
        //                                                                  ^^^^
        //      make whole attribute disappear if disclosure-div is not rendered
    }

    isOpened.data.render {
        if (it) {
            div(id = "disclosure") {
                +"I am open!"
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### Structure UI

It's very easy to create a lightweight reusable component with fritz2. Basically all you have to do is write a function
with `RenderContext` as its receiver type:

```kotlin
fun RenderContext.myComponent() {
    p {
        +"This is the smallest valid stateless component"
    }
}

render {
    myComponent()
}
```

Of course, you can also use a subtype of `RenderContext` like a certain `Tag` as receiver if you want to limit the usage
of your component to this type as its parent.

By using plain functions, it's also straight forward to parametrize your component:

```kotlin
fun RenderContext.myOtherComponent(person: Person) {
    p {
        +"Hello, my name is ${person.name}!"
    }
}

val somePerson = Person(...)
render {
    div {
        myOtherComponent(somePerson)
    }
}
```

To allow nested components, use a lambda with `RenderContext` as its receiver, or the type of the element you are
calling this lambda in:

```kotlin
// return a html element if you need it
fun RenderContext.container(content: RenderContext.() -> Unit) {
    div("container") {
        content()
    }
}

render {
    container {
        p {
            +"Hello World!"
        }

        clicks handledBy someHandler // you will see what this does in the next chapter
    }
}
```

Using `Div` as receiver type in the example above allows you to access the specific attributes and events of your
container-element from your content-lambda. Use `RenderContext` if this is not necessary or intended.


## Advanced Topics

### Scope

fritz2 offers the option to use a `Scope` to add some information to a tag which can then be received by any
child-tag of the corresponding DOM-subtree and which will not be rendered out by default. The values in the `Scope` are
only available for tags inside the context of the tag which sets them.

To append something to the `Scope` you have to create a `Scope.Key` by using the
`Scope.keyOf()` function.
```kotlin
val myKey = Scope.keyOf<String>("myKeyName")
```
The key is needed to set or get a value to the `Scope`.
```kotlin
val fooKey = Scope.keyOf<String>("foo")

render {
    div(scope = {
        set(fooKey, "bar")
    }) {
        div {
            // div is child of scope owner, so key is accessible
            +(scope[fooKey] ?: "")
        }
    }
    div {
        // this div is not a child, so key is not in its (empty) scope
        +(scope[fooKey] ?: "")
    }
}
```
The result is the following:
```html
<div>
    <div>bar</div>
</div>
<div></div>
```
For debugging proposes you can use the `scope.asDataAttr()` function to set current scope to the tag and see it
in the DOM-Tree.
