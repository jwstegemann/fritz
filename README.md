fritz2 is a proof of concept for an ***extremely lightweight***, well-performing, independent library for client-side ui in ***Kotlin*** heavily depending on coroutines and flows.

fritz2 includes an intuitive way to build and render html-elements using a type-safe dsl. You can easily create lightweight **reactive** html-components that are bound to an underlying model and **automatically** change whenever the model data changes:

```kotlin
val model = RootStore<String>("init value")

render {
    div("some-css-class") {
        input {
            value = model.data
            changes.values() handledBy model.update 
        }
        p {
            text("model value = ")
            store.data.bind()
        }
    }
}.mount("target")
```

fritz2 implements **precise data binding**. This means that when parts of your data model change, **exactly those** and ONLY those DOM-nodes depending on the changed parts will automatically change as well.

No intermediate layer (like a virtual DOM) is needed. fritz2 requires no additional methods to decide which parts of your component have to be re-rendered:

![State management in fritz2](https://www.fritz2.dev/static/fritz2_state.001.png)

Utilizing Kotlin's multiplatform-abilities, you'll write the code of your data classes only once and use it on your client and server (i.e. in a [SpringBoot](https://spring.io/guides/gs/rest-service/)-Backend). This is also true for your model-validation-code, which can quickly become far more complex than your data model.

Expect a flat learning curve - we chose Kotlin for its focus on writing clean and intuitive code, which makes working with fritz2 easy to learn.
fritz2 itself depends on only a handful of [concepts](https://docs.fritz2.dev) you have to master. The [core API](https://api.fritz2.dev/fritz2/) consists of about a dozen key objects and types offering only essential methods und functions. 

## How to try it?

* Take a look at our hosted [examples](https://www.fritz2.dev/examples.html)
* Or set up a new project on your own, following our [documentation](https://docs.fritz2.dev/Project.html)
* Or checkout the project, import it in your favourite IDE and run `./gradlew :examples:todomvc:run` (or any other example)


## What we've got so far

- easy reactive one- and two-way-databinding
- even for lists and deep nested structures
- complete set of html5 elements, attributes and events
- hassle-free redux-like state-handling
- model-validation and message handling 
- routing (for SPAs, hash-based)
- [examples](https://www.fritz2.dev/examples.html) i.e. implementing the specification of [TodoMVC](http://todomvc.com/)
- server-communication (Rest APIs, etc.)
- [documentation](https://docs.fritz2.dev) (work in progress)

## Overall Goals

- staying extremely lightweight (a few hundred lines of code for the core)
- keeping dependencies as low as possible (zero up to now!)
- generating elements, attributes, events for html from specification (w3c, mozilla, ...)

## Inspiration

fritz2 is hugely inspired by the great [Binding.scala](https://github.com/ThoughtWorksInc/Binding.scala). Later we discovered that a lot of those concepts are described independently in [Meiosis](https://meiosis.js.org/).
