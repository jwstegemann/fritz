fritz2 is an ***extremely lightweight***, well-performing, independent library to build reactive web apps in ***Kotlin*** heavily depending on coroutines and flows.

fritz2 includes an intuitive way to build and render html-elements and styles using a type-safe dsl. You can easily create lightweight **reactive** html-components that are bound to an underlying model and **automatically** change whenever the model data changes:

```kotlin
val model = storeOf("init value")

render {
    div("some-css-class") {
        input {
            value(model.data)
            changes.values() handledBy model.update 
        }
        p {
            +"model value = "
            model.data.asText()
        }
    }
}
```

fritz2 implements **precise data binding**. This means that when parts of your data model change, **exactly those** and only those DOM-nodes depending on the changed parts will automatically change as well. No intermediate layer (like a virtual DOM) is needed. fritz2 requires no additional methods to decide which parts of your component have to be re-rendered:

![State management in fritz2](https://www.fritz2.dev/static/fritz2_state.001.png)

Utilizing Kotlin's multiplatform-abilities, you'll write the code of your data classes only once and use it on your client and server (i.e. in a [SpringBoot](https://github.com/jamowei/fritz2-spring-todomvc)- or [Ktor](https://github.com/jamowei/fritz2-ktor-todomvc)-Backend). This is also true for your model-validation-code, which can quickly become far more complex than your data model.

## Key Features

- easy reactive one- and two-way-databinding (even for lists and deep nested structures)
- hassle-free redux-like state-handling
- model-validation and message handling 
- integrated [styling-dsl](https://docs.fritz2.dev/StylingDSL.html)
- [component-library](https://components.fritz2.dev)
- routing (for SPAs, hash-based)
- backend-repositories (Rest APIs, WebSockets, LocalStorage, etc.)
- history / undo
- processing state ("spinning wheel")
- easy to learn  
- [documentation](https://docs.fritz2.dev)
- [examples](https://www.fritz2.dev/examples.html) i.e. implementing the specification of [TodoMVC](http://todomvc.com/)


## How to try it?

* Take a look at our hosted [examples](https://www.fritz2.dev/examples.html)
* Or set up a new project on your own, following our [documentation](https://docs.fritz2.dev/ProjectSetup.html)

## Overall Goals

- staying lightweight (a few hundred lines of code for the core)
- keeping dependencies as low as possible (zero up to now!)
- generating elements, attributes, events for html from specification (w3c, mozilla, ...)
- make it as easy as possible to write reactive pwas in pure kotlin

## Inspiration

fritz2 is hugely inspired by the great [Binding.scala](https://github.com/ThoughtWorksInc/Binding.scala). Later we discovered that a lot of those concepts are described independently in [Meiosis](https://meiosis.js.org/).

## Leave us a star...

If you like the idea of a lightweight pure Kotlin implementation for building reactive web apps, please give us a star on github. Thank you.
